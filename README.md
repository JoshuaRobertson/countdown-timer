###Having issues?
You might need to simply import Electron Forge first

See: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#package-and-distribute-the-application

### Other distribution options

Here we've used Electron Forge, but there are other (potentially better distribution packages) distribution packages available: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-distribution#application-distribution
